# Currency Tracker

_build with ReactJS_

## Overview

This program enables a precise currency conversion for the most common currencies.

## Functionality

On the left side of the program, the base-currency and the second currency can be choosen from a list, initially the currencies are set as _EUR_ and _USD_. Below, the conversion-rate for the currency can be read as: _1_ EUR is worth _x_ USD. <br />
On the right side  a line-diagram maps the conversion-rate of the second currency for the preceeding month.

## Data

This project uses the data from the API of [Rates API](https://ratesapi.io/), which includes over 30 currencies and daily real-time data published by the European Central Bank. <br />
I do not guarantee the accuracy of the data.

## Acknowledgement

This program was build purely with ReactJS. The development of this project was independent.
